# Meal Planner

This app was built for me and my partner to use to plan our weekly food shop. It includes three main sections, which interact with eachother.
Section one is the pantry where the user can keep up to date with what ingredients they have, and how much they cost.
Section two is a recipe book where the user can add recipes they like, and it will show if they have the correct ingredients.
Section three is the meal planner. The user can make a weekly plan, add recipes for each day (based on their recipe book), and then generate a shopping list with estimated prices based on what they are missing from their pantry.
Firebase services were used for the database and user-authentication. The main challenge I overcame when building this project was how to properly structure NoSQL database collections and relate them to eachother.
